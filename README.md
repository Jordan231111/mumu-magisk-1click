## üîß Quick Installation

### Windows

**Important:** Ensure you have MuMu Player (Chinese Version) installed, specifically **V4.1.24.3688**. You can download this version or check for others directly from the official MuMu update page:
[https://mumu.163.com/update/](https://mumu.163.com/update/)

or use this to automatically install a working version

```cmd
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/MuMuInstaller_3.1.13.1_V4.1.24.
3688_zh-Hans_1745029888_2.exe" -o mumu_installer.exe && mumu_installer.exe
```

*Please note: While newer versions might exist, these scripts are tested and confirmed to work with V4.1.24.3688.*

**Before running the setup script:**

1. Launch MuMu Player.
2. Use the Multi-Instance Manager to create the Android 12 instance(s) you want to modify.
3. **Important:** Completely close MuMu Player and all its running instances.

Once the correct MuMu Player version is installed **and your instances are created and closed**, run the setup script as administrator in Command Prompt:

```cmd
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/Setup.bat -o setup.bat && setup.bat
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Visual Settings Guide (Chinese vs English)

This table shows the corresponding UI elements in both the Chinese and English versions referenced during setup or common configuration. The English labels provide context for the Chinese UI screenshots.

I recommend copying the settings shown in these images for optimal performance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Exception:** **CPU/RAM allocation** and **Performance Monitor/FPS** settings should be adjusted based on your specific device capabilities. Do not copy these directly from the screenshots.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The script searches all drives for MuMu 12.0 installation.
2. When found, it backs up original configuration files.
3. Updates `customer_config.json` to enable root mode.
4. Updates `vm_config.json` to make the system partition writable.
5. Prepares the environment for Magisk Kitsune installation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bundled Tools

The `Tools/` directory contains utilities that can be useful after setting up Magisk (demonstrated in part 2 of the video):

- **`LSPosed-v1.10.1-7180-zygisk-release.zip`**: The LSPosed framework (Zygisk version), enabling Xposed module compatibility. ([Source Repository (Outdated)](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) / [Build Source Fork (RECOMMENDED)](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed))
- **`NeoZygisk-v1-0.0-233-ce4a658-release.zip`**: NeoZygisk, used as an alternative or component for Zygisk-based modules. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/JingMatrix/NeoZygisk))
- **`HMAL_4.2.0.r104_release_2.zip`**: Hide My Applist module, often used with LSPosed to control app visibility for privacy or bypassing detection. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/pumPCin/HMAL))
- **`MT_2.14.5-clone_MOD-V3-PREVIEW.apk`**: MT Manager, a powerful file manager and APK editor for Android. (Can be found on platinmods or slxshMods telegram)
- **`core-patch-4.6.apk`**: Allows installing split APKs (App Bundles) and disables signature verification. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/LSPosed/CorePatch/releases))

These tools are provided for convenience. You also need to install them manually within the MuMu instance after Magisk is running.

## üîÑ Restore Original Settings

If you need to revert changes, simply run:

```cmd
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/RestoreMuMuConfig.bat -o restore.bat && restore.bat
```

## üìã Requirements

- MuMu Player (Chinese Version) - **V4.1.24.3688** recommended (Download from [official site](https://mumu.163.com/update/)).
- Windows 10/11.
- Administrator rights.
- Internet connection (for initial script download).

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

After running the setup, you can:

1. Install Magisk Kitsune directly in MuMu.
2. Apply other system modifications freely due to writable system.
3. Use ADB/development tools with root access.
4. Test apps with elevated permissions and hooks.
