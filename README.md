## üîß Quick Installation

### Windows

**Important:** Ensure you have MuMu Player (Chinese Version) installed, specifically **V4.1.24.3688**. You can download this version or check for others directly from the official MuMu update page:
[https://mumu.163.com/update/](https://mumu.163.com/update/)

or run this in Command Prompt to automatically install a working version

```cmd
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/MuMuInstaller_3.1.13.1_V4.1.25.3699_zh-Hans_1745636834.exe" -o mumu_installer.exe && mumu_installer.exe
```

*Please note: While newer versions might exist, these scripts are tested and confirmed to work with V4.1.24.3688.*

**Before running the setup script:**

1. Launch MuMu Player.
2. Download and install [Kitsune Magisk](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk/releases) (`app-release.apk`) - a fork of Magisk specifically optimized for emulators. This file is also included in the `Tools/` directory of this repository.
3. Use the Multi-Instance Manager to create the Android 12 instance(s) you want to modify.
4. **Important:** Open and launch the created instances at least once.
5. **Important:** Completely close MuMu Player and all its running instances.

Once MuMu Player and Kitsune Magisk are installed **and your instances have been launched and then closed**, run the setup script as administrator in Command Prompt:

```cmd
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/Setup.bat -o setup.bat && setup.bat
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Visual Settings Guide (Chinese vs English)

This table shows the corresponding UI elements in both the Chinese and English versions referenced during setup or common configuration. The English labels provide context for the Chinese UI screenshots.

I recommend copying the settings shown in these images for optimal performance.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The script searches all drives for MuMu 12.0 installation.
2. When found, it backs up original configuration files.
3. Updates `customer_config.json` to enable root mode.
4. Updates `vm_config.json` to make the system partition writable.
5. Prepares the environment for Magisk Kitsune installation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bundled Tools

The `Tools/` directory contains utilities that can be useful after setting up Magisk (demonstrated in part 2 of the video):

- **`app-release.apk`**: Kitsune Magisk installer - a fork of Magisk specifically optimized for emulators. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/1q23lyc45/KitsuneMagisk/releases))
- **`LSPosed-v1.10.1-7180-zygisk-release.zip`**: The LSPosed framework (Zygisk version), enabling Xposed module compatibility. ([Source Repository (Outdated)](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) / [Build Source Fork (RECOMMENDED)](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed))
- **`NeoZygisk-v1-0.0-233-ce4a658-release.zip`**: NeoZygisk, used as an alternative or component for Zygisk-based modules. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/JingMatrix/NeoZygisk))
- **`HMAL_4.2.0.r104_release_2.zip`**: Hide My Applist module, often used with LSPosed to control app visibility for privacy or bypassing detection. ([Source Repository](https://github.com/pumPCin/HMAL))

These tools are provided for convenience. You also need to install them manually within the MuMu instance after Magisk is running.
