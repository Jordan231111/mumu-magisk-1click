### Windows

**Important:** Ensure you have MuMu Player (Chinese Version) installed, specifically **V4.1.24.3688**. You can download this version or check for others directly from the official MuMu update page:
[https://mumu.163.com/update/](https://mumu.163.com/update/)
or

```cmd
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/MuMuInstaller_3.1.13.1_V4.1.24.
3688_zh-Hans_1745029888_2.exe" -o mumu_installer.exe && mumu_installer.exe
```

*Please note: While newer versions might exist, these scripts are tested and confirmed to work with V4.1.24.3688.*

**Before running the setup script:**

1. Launch MuMu Player.
2. Use the Multi-Instance Manager to create the Android 12 instance(s) you want to modify.
3. **Important:** Completely close MuMu Player and all its running instances.

Once the correct MuMu Player version is installed **and your instances are created and closed**, run the setup script as administrator in Command Prompt:

```cmd
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan231111/mumu-magisk-1click/main/Setup.bat -o setup.bat && setup.bat
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The script searches all drives for MuMu 12.0 installation.
2. When found, it backs up original configuration files.
3. Updates `customer_config.json` to enable root mode.
4. Updates `vm_config.json` to make the system partition writable.
5. Prepares the environment for Magisk Kitsune installation.
